# Noirly Flow — Web Features

**Product:** Noirly Flow (web only)  
**Audience:** Product, engineering, and onboarding  
**Status:** Inventory of features implemented in the current web app  
**Companion:** [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) (target design); this doc reflects **what ships today**

This document covers the **Next.js web app** in `noirly-flow` only. Native / React Native (`NoirlyFlow`) is out of scope.

---

## 1. Snapshot

Noirly Flow is a dark-mode task and project manager for individuals and teams. Auth is **Noirly Identity** (OIDC). Data lives in **MongoDB** (Flow DB). Live board updates go through **noirly-realtime** when configured.

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Auth (Identity OIDC + Google One Tap via Identity) | Done |
| Personal + team workspaces | Done |
| Projects, Inbox, list / board / calendar | Done |
| Tasks (CRUD, filters, DnD, checklist, subtasks, recurrence) | Done |
| Assignees, tags, comments, activity + CSV | Done |
| RBAC (viewer → owner) | Done |
| Invite links | Done |
| Cmd+K command palette + search API | Done |
| Profile settings | Done |
| Realtime board sync + presence | Done (when WS URL set) |

---

## 2. Authentication & identity

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Noirly Identity OIDC | Auth.js (NextAuth v5); scopes `openid profile email offline_access` |
| Login UI | “Noirly Login” opens popup OIDC (`/login/popup` → `/login/popup-complete`) |
| Google | One Tap / GSI on Flow; Google IdP lives on **Identity**, not as a Flow provider |
| Session gate | Unauthenticated users → `/login`; API accepts cookie session or Identity Bearer |
| First-login bootstrap | Upserts Flow user; creates **Personal** workspace + default project **Inbox board** (Todo / In progress / Done) |
| Sign out | Shell footer + dedicated action |
| Landing redirect | Signed-in `/` → personal workspace |

**Routes:** `/login`, `/login/popup`, `/login/popup-complete`

---

## 3. App shell & navigation

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| App shell | Sidebar: workspaces, Inbox, Board, Settings, Activity, Members; mobile drawer |
| Workspace switcher | List + create team; last workspace remembered in `sessionStorage` |
| Project nav | Per-workspace: Inbox + project list + New project |
| Optimistic navigation | Pending href + optimistic path for snappy sidebar clicks |

## 6. Tasks

### 6.1 Core

| --- | --- |
| CRUD | Create / update / soft-delete with optimistic cache updates |
| Inbox | Unfiled tasks (`projectId: null`) |
| Quick add | Title + priority + due date |

Title, description, status, priority, project, due date, recurrence, assignees, tags, checklist, subtasks, comments, per-task activity. Escape closes.

### 6.4 Rich fields

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Checklist | Add / toggle / remove (persisted on task) |
| Subtasks | `parentTaskId`; create + mark done (one level in list) |
| Assignees | Multi-select workspace members |
| Tags | Workspace tags; create + attach (default color; no color picker UI) |
| Recurrence | Daily / weekly (interval 1 in UI); completing spawns next occurrence |

## 7. Collaboration

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Comments | List + create on a task (optimistic) |
| Activity verbs | `task.created`, `task.updated`, `task.assigned`, `task.deleted`, `comment.created` |

## 8. Access control (RBAC)

Roles: **viewer** &lt; **member** &lt; **admin** &lt; **owner**

| Capability | Minimum role |
| --- | --- |
| `workspace.view` | viewer+ |
| `task.write` / `project.write` | member+ |
| `members.manage` | admin+ |

Enforced on API (`requireMembership` / `requireWorkspaceRole`) and reflected in UI (viewers are read-only for writes). Guards: cannot demote last owner; cannot change own role; only owner can assign owner.

---

## 9. Members & invites

| Role change / remove | Admin+; cannot remove self |
| Invite link | One-time token, 7-day expiry, hashed; roles admin / member / viewer; copy `/invite/[token]` |

| --- | --- |
| Command palette | **Cmd/Ctrl+K** (`cmdk`) |
| Palette actions | Create task / project from query (if permitted); jump Inbox / Activity / workspaces / Settings |
| Search API | Debounced (≥2 chars) → `GET /api/search?q=` (tasks + workspace names, membership-scoped) |
| Open hits | Project or inbox with `?task=` |
| Shortcuts | `/` focuses in-page task search; `C` opens palette; `1` list, `2` board, `3` calendar (on project) |

| `/settings` | Identity name / email + link to Identity `/account` |
| Flow profile | Display name, title, timezone (fixed list), bio via `GET/PATCH /api/me` |
| Display name usage | Members, comments, boards |

**Not in product yet:** separate profile / preferences routes; theme / density / default-view preferences; calendar still uses browser local time for filters.

---

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Client | `@noirly-dev/realtime-client` via `FlowRealtimeProvider` |
| Token | `GET /api/realtime/token` — workspace subscribe; project subscribe + presence |

## 15. Explicitly not done (web)

Tracked here so architecture plans are not mistaken for shipped product:

- Dedicated `/search`, workspace settings, per-view board/list/calendar URLs, task deep-link page
- Project / workspace / column admin (rename, archive, delete, custom columns, tag color picker)
- Email invites, notifications, mentions, billing
- Comment edit/delete, soft-delete restore
- Full RRULE; `blocked` status; `startAt` UI
- Presence task-focus highlight; Inbox realtime
- Light theme toggle; offline CRDT; chat / video (architecture non-goals)
